<center>
<p>Assalam-o-Alaikum. My name is Nauman Asif and I am a freshman of Computer Engineering at GIKI.</p>
<h1>Achievements</h1>
<p>I scored a total of 940 out of 1100 in my SSC Examination and went to Edwardes College Peshawar for my Fsc in Pre-Engineering and scored 834 in my HSSC Examination. Before the results of HSSC were released I was able to get admission into GIKI and am now spending my life here at GIKI</p>
<h2>Ambitions</h2>
<p>My ambition currently is to score good and always stay above in the relative marking system of GIKI, as well as maintaining a good GPA of 3.0 so that in future after graduating I would not have any regrets.</p>
